# SerialKillers
Statistical analysis of the relationship between the age of first murder and motive in a sample of serial killers.

## Skills 
R, statistical analysis, data cleaning, data visualisation, written report

## Aims
* Obtain, clean and prepare data for analysis.
* Test a hypothesis using statistical analysis on a random sample.

## Methods
* Take a sample, clean the data and prepare it for analysis.
* Explore the data 
  * Find the mean and standard deviations of Age of first kill, age of last kill and ‘career duration’.
  * Find the unique ‘Motives’ in the dataset 
* Estimate the distribution or the three variables. 
  * Plot individual histograms for the age first kill, last kill and career duration. 
  * Plot these against a normal distribution and exponential distribution density curves – compare these against the shape of the histogram to estimate a distribution of the data for each variable.
* Conduct Z testing and t-testing on Age first kill. 
  * Tested against previous study’s sample means and sd using the same data. 
  * Significant agreement. Suggests our sample is a good representation of the dataset.
* Evaluating the motives. 
  * Finding means and SD age first kill for motives: ‘Mental Illness’, ‘Angel of Death’, and ‘Escape or avoid arrest’.
  * Test to see if these variables have a normal distribution using Komolgorov-Smirnof test (KS test). 
  * Conduct t-tests of each variables mean age first kill against entire sample mean. 
  * Mental health is the only variable that agrees significantly with sample mean. Is this because it makes up the majority of the dataset?
